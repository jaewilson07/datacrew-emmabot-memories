# Google Docs Gotchas

- **`write_markdown_to_tab` always appends** — use `Tab.write(content, mode='replace')` or `Tabs.upsert(doc_id, title, content)` which handles lookup, clearing, and writing in one call
- **Markdown blockquotes (`> `) are stripped** — cboti's converter drops them entirely. Use bold-labeled paragraphs (`**Label:**` + regular paragraph) instead
- **Tab IDs are document-scoped** — a tab ID from one doc fails on another. Always `Tabs.list(doc_id)` for the target doc before writing
- **Always upsert tabs, never create-then-replace** — `Tabs.upsert(doc_id, title, content)` finds by title and replaces. Creating new docs or appending creates duplicates
